## Run setup
Step 1: First Execute the command `npm i or npm install`

## Run server

Step 2: run the server by command  `ng serve` it will run `http:://localhost:4200`

## Build

Run build by command `ng build`

## Tech Question 1
Question 1: ( compulsory )
Create a file upload feature in Angular that accepts any image or video files, less than 10
MB and upload the file to the firebase storage.
Add some some interactions or animations like upload progress and file upload status
Add a preview of the file that has been uploaded.
Place appropriate validations and error messages wherever required

## Tech Question 2
Question 2:
Write a simple application using a recursive function that accepts a value (integer) and returns the fibonacci value at that position in the series.
The application should be performant at scale to handle larger numbers without slowing down exponentially.

## Tech Question3
Question 3:
A string is balanced if it consists of exactly two different characters and both of those characters appear exactly the same number of times. For example: "aaibab" is balanced (both 'a' and 'b' occur three times) but "aabba" is not balanced (a' occurs three times, 'b' occurs two times). String "aabbcc" is also not balanced (it contains three different letters).A substring of string S is a string that consists of consecutive letters in
S. For example: "ompu" is a substring of "computer" but "cmptr" is not. Write a function solution called getBalancedSubstrings(List<String> S) that, given a string S, returns an array of the longest balanced substring of S.Examples:
1. Given S = "cabbacc", the function should return ["abba"] because it is the longest
balanced substring.
2. Given S = "abababa", the function should return "ababab", "bababa"] which are the
longest balanced substrings.
3. Given S = "aaaaaaa"
, the function should return [] since S does not contain a
balanced substring. Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
- N is an integer within the range [1.. 100,000];
- string S is made only of lowercase letters (a-z).
